# Development validation

Baseline: Minecraft 1.26.51.01, LeviLamina Client 26.51.3, Windows x64.

## Confirmed for the initial camera/settings prototype

- Release DLL compilation and mod packaging completed.
- Camera state tests passed: inactive pass-through, held projection scaling,
  sensitivity, wheel limits, transient reset, invalid configuration, small FOV.
- Minecraft loaded Lamium with the older feature mods disabled.
- F8 opened the local settings panel from a creative world.
- Arrow keys changed magnification from 3.0 to 3.5.
- Clicking Save closed the panel and wrote 3.5 to the settings file.
- Reopening the panel showed the saved value.
- Toggling Zoom off and pressing Escape discarded the change; reopening still
  showed Zoom on.
- The panel rendered with the Deesse UI 1.3.9 resource pack enabled.

These observations validate the UI prototype, not the whole feature suite.

Settings now use a viewport that keeps the selected row visible in short windows.
Arrow keys and the wheel navigate all rows, including Save/Cancel. Queued actions
retain their original target row when selection moves before the next render.
Layout tests cover 100–480 GUI-unit heights, row hit testing, navigation wrapping,
footer separation, and tiny-window fallback. In game, resizing the window to
263 pixels high changed the list to six visible rows; wheel/Tab navigation
reached Save, and Enter persisted a changed preview setting. Mouse toggling also
worked at that size. The window was subsequently maximized for ordinary use.
Keyboard selection and pointer hover now use separate colors after this check
showed hover could obscure the selected row; this color adjustment builds but
still needs runtime verification.

## Lighting and settings persistence

- NightVision toggled on with N in an Overworld night scene, visibly brightened
  the same terrain, then returned to normal lighting when toggled off.
- The View settings panel displayed the NightVision state.
- An additive-settings regression was found during restart verification: the
  initial SDK deserializer rejected a missing lighting section and reset camera
  preferences. Settings now use a backward-compatible decoder.
- Regression tests preserve a 3.5x preference from the original camera-only
  schema, supply defaults for missing sections, reject invalid/future schemas,
  preserve unknown fields, and round-trip through a real settings file.
- A locked-destination test confirms failed replacement preserves the previous
  file and removes the temporary file.
- A full Minecraft restart with the revised decoder preserved the saved 3.5x
  magnification from a file without the new inspection section. F8 showed 3.5x,
  with container previews and durability correctly defaulting to enabled.

## Item inspection prototype

- Shulker/Bundle preview providers and numeric durability display compile in
  the release DLL; layout, bundle fingerprint, and durability-bar tests pass.
- The updated DLL loaded in Minecraft. In the creative inventory, hovering a
  diamond sword displayed `Durability: 1561 / 1561` above the vanilla tooltip.
  Moving to a renamed diamond pickaxe updated the tooltip without a crash.
- A filled Shulker displayed its 9x3 contents grid, counts, and empty slots above
  the vanilla tooltip. Moving to another UI control removed the preview.
- A Bundle updated from empty to 32 bricks, then 32 bricks plus 32 slimeballs,
  then back to 32 bricks after extraction, without closing the inventory.
  Its grid matched the vanilla tooltip's contents and counts at each step.
- Cache keys now include live Bundle entries' metadata and Shulker NBT hashes,
  covering updates that keep item IDs/counts and tag addresses unchanged.
  Metadata-only invalidation tests and the release build pass; that specific
  mutation scenario still needs runtime validation.
- Saving previews Off removed Lamium's Bundle grid while retaining the vanilla
  tooltip. The setting was also confirmed in the saved configuration.
- Saving previews On restored the Bundle grid and the filled Shulker grid in
  the build with metadata hashing. Both rendered after a full game restart.
- Damaged tools and larger Bundles still require runtime checks.

## Inventory sorting prototype

- Integrated a pure consolidation/ordering planner, vanilla item classification,
  ordinary container transfers, text-focus tracking, and an R binding.
- Settings independently enable sorting and storage-container targeting.
- Release DLL builds. Planner/key tests cover consolidation, fixed slots,
  region bounds, full inventories, deterministic/idempotent ordering, custom
  names, enchantments, damage, and Shulker content signatures.
- Runtime execution now issues one vanilla transfer at a time, captures its
  new request IDs from the client's pending batch, and waits for matching server
  responses before checking the whole region and issuing the next transfer.
- Response-barrier tests cover multiple IDs, unrelated/old responses, duplicate
  replies, rejection, absent capture, and a five-second timeout. The release DLL
  links against exported container and packet-handler functions.
- Screen exit, loss of UI focus, changed contents, text editing, and disabling
  sorting cancel the remaining plan. Already-issued transfers remain owned by
  vanilla; Lamium does not synthesize a rollback.
- The response-aware build loaded in game. An R press in the creative inventory
  planned five operations around one locked slot, applied the first swap, then
  stopped with an untracked-request result. The update callback did not capture
  that swap's request ID. Capture now compares the client's pending request batch
  immediately before and after each vanilla transfer. It refuses to begin while
  another request scope is active.
- With pending-batch capture, the remaining four swaps completed in a local
  creative world: the log recorded four acknowledged operations. The 12 occupied
  slots retained their displayed counts; the locked five-log stack and hotbar
  remained in place. Repeating R planned zero operations.
- Splitting an unlocked 64-log stack into two stacks of 32 then pressing R
  completed one acknowledged merge and restored 64. Pressing R while the split
  stack was held on the cursor was refused without issuing a transfer.
- Typing R into the creative search field entered a search character and issued
  no sort operation (confirmed from the live log).
- These checks used Deesse UI 1.3.9. Storage containers, survival inventories,
  other text-input screens, live cancellation, rejected requests, and remote-server
  latency still require runtime checks.
- A separate rotating Lamium log flushes informational messages while the game
  is running; request completion was verified from this log as well as the UI.

## Outstanding release gates

Build automation: a Windows CI workflow, dependency lock, and package checker
have been added. The local locked configuration builds, passes the test suite,
and passes the package check. A hosted CI run and a fresh dependency-cache
restore have not yet been verified.

A separate clone with no project build output also completed configuration,
DLL compilation/packaging, test compilation/execution, and the package check.
Its dependency lock remained unchanged. This reused the machine's downloaded
dependency cache, so it is evidence for a clean checkout build, not a clean
dependency restore.

- Verify zoom visually while held, wheel capture, sensitivity, and release.
- Verify menu transitions, focus loss, dimension changes, disconnect/rejoin.
- Verify all settings survive restart and in-game errors preserve existing files.
- Improve keyboard/mouse focus feedback, small-window layout, actual binding
  hints, localization, and gamepad/touch behavior.
- Verify with vanilla UI and additional UI resource packs.
- Verify NightVision underwater, in Nether/End, and across restart/dimension changes.
- Complete runtime validation of previews and durability; verify the remaining
  inventory scenarios listed above.
- Verify hosted CI and a clean dependency restore/build/package.
- Complete dependency notices and distribution review.
